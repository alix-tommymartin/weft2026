    <h2>About the tournament</h2>
    <p>
        The event pursues a dual ambition: <strong> to promote a sport that is both more inclusive and more sustainable. </strong> 
        On the social side, the tournament will feature an n&Out stand raising awareness about inclusion and mental health,
        a “Women in Business & Sport” roundtable with inspiring women from the sports world,
        and an inter-promotion gala match bringing together former and current FHF players.
        Environmentally, the WEFT will implement an eco-differentiated pricing system,
        distribute sustainable welcome kits, and provide local seasonal meals with vegetarian options.
        With a zero-waste goal and 100% of participants housed on campus to prevent transport emissions,
        WEFT 2026 embodies the commitment of a new generation to a <strong>female, united, and responsible sport.</strong>
